    <h1>Pork Sinigang</h1>
    <img src="../images/porksinigang.jpg" alt="Pork Sinigang">
    <p>Sinigang na Baboy with Gabi is a popular Filipino soup dish. It has pork belly with vegetables such as okra,
        kangkong (ong choy), snake beans, onion, dikon radish, and taro. It is cooked in a sour broth. The souring agent
        is usually unripe tamarind. This recipe makes use of sinigang sa sampaloc mix, which is the powdered version of
        tamarind.</p>
    <p>Sinigang na baboy is best eaten with spicy fish sauce (this is also called patis in the Philippines). I scoop a
        few fish sauce using a spoon and pour it over the pork, and then eat it with rice.</p>
    <p>This sinigang version is special because of the taro. This ingredient is locally referred to as gabi. It helps
        make the soup thicker.</p>
