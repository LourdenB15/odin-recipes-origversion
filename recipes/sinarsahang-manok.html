    <p>While I also love my fair share of lunches and dinners spent outside, there is something undeniably special about
        a home-cooked meal. Not only does it emulate a one of a kind atmosphere of warmth and comfort, but it often
        tastes most fresh coming from your own kitchen. And don't even get me started on the particular appeal of a
        home-cooked Filipino dish. Most of our family favorites are recipes with a great deal of vegetables, as well as
        a lovingly fragrant stew. Let me introduce you to one particular dish that falls under the category, and will
        definitely bring you back to the taste of home— Sinarsahang Manok!</p>
    <p>Without a doubt, we, Filipinos, love our sauces and stews with a tomato base. From the occasional Menudo to
        Afritada, dishes featuring the lycopene-rich fruit (although often mistaken for a vegetable) probably count as
        our bread and butter. But one recipe that we may talk about less, but surely deserves all the recognition as
        well, is Sinarsahang Manok. Like I mentioned earlier, it has all the right elements to make a perfectly
        irresistible home-cooked Filipino meal. It coats our tender chicken with sautéed onions, garlic, tomato sauce,
        soy sauce and more.</p>
    <p>But other than its pleasant array of seasonings, it also balances out the dish's texture with some green peas,
        bell peppers and green beans. It definitely doesn't skimp on vegetables for the dish's overall health factor.
        But that's enough talking about Sinarsahang Manok.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ lbs chicken</li>
        <li>1 piece bell pepper, Julienne</li>
        <li>1 piece Knorr Chicken Cube</li>
        <li>½ cup green peas</li>
        <li>6 pieces long green beans, sliced</li>
        <li>1 piece onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 piece tomato, diced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>8 ounces tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>½ cup tomato ketchup</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan. Sauté the bell pepper, green peas, and long green beans for 45 seconds.
            Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add remaining oil. Once oil becomes hot, pan-fry chicken pieces for 3 minutes per side. Remove chicken from
            the pan and place on a clean plate. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Sauté garlic, onion, and tomato using the remaining oil. Add soy sauce, tomato sauce, and water once the
            onion softens. Let it boil.</li>
        <li>Add Knorr chicken cube and then put the chicken piece back into the pan. Cover the pan and continue cooking
            the chicken using medium heat for 15 minutes. Remove the cover and cook until the sauce becomes thick.</li>
        <li>Add back the stir-fried vegetables.</li>
        <li>Season with sugar, salt, and ground black pepper. Transfer to a serving plate. Serve!</li>
    </ol>
